# Flutter GetX Users

This repository contains a simple Flutter app designed to fetch and display fake user data from an external API. The application also features an offline mode, enabling the display of locally stored data when an internet connection is unavailable. 

The architecture follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**. 

For state management and navigation, we leverage the [Get package](https://pub.dev/packages/get), which streamlines these aspects, allowing for efficient and clean development.
